Ancient Egypt
=============
How did the civilization of Ancient Egypt start?  When did it end, or did it?
What's the difference between the Old Kingdom and the New Kingdom?  We've
all grown up with images of Ancient Egypt in our heads, but with precious few
details of this amazing civilization.  This ambitious NST will lay a framework
for the evolution of a land that has borne countless people, cities, and
cultures for over 6,000 years.

The Nile
--------
Egypt was called the "Gift of the Nile" for the many favorable attributes of
the river.  It allowed easy transport: going downstream was easy due to the
current, and the dominant wind blew from the north, facilitating sailing
upstream.  It was very fertile: regular flooding[1] provided predictable
irrigation and fertilization, augmented by ample sunlight.  Additionally, the
desert to the east was rich in gold.

The Nile flows north from Khartoum (in current Sudan) approximately 3000 km to
the Nile Delta, draining into the Mediterranean.  Upstream/south of Khartoum
the Nile splits into the Blue Nile (which sources from Ethiopia) and the White
Nile (which comes Lake Victoria and further south).  Between Khartoum and the
Mediterranean are six cataracts that impede navigation; there have often been
military and/or commercial checkpoints at the cataracts.  Ancient Egypt is
based on the portion of the Nile between the first cataract (at Aswan) and the
Mediterranean.  South of Aswan lies the land called Nubia or Kush.

Egypt was divided geographically and politically into Lower Egypt and Upper
Egypt[2].  Lower (northern) Egypt was centered in the Nile Delta, it had wide
expanses of arable (and sometimes swampy) land, access to the Mediterranean and
closer cultural connections with the Levant.  Modern Cairo and ancient Memphis
sit at the strategic point where the Nile fans out into the delta.  Upper
(southern) Egypt was in the Nile Valley, a narrow (~1 mile) wide strip of
arable land around the Nile.  Upper Egypt had more cultural and trade connections
to Nubia and Sub-saharan Africa.  Ancient Thebes and Luxor sit in Upper Egypt.

<footnote>
[1] The Nile flooded predictably; in fact the Egyptian calendar was divided into
three seasons: flooding, emergence (and planting), and harvest.
<br />
[2] They even had different [crowns][CrownsOfEgypt].
</footnote>

The Neolithic
-------
Neolithic Egypt was the product of two cultures, a northern Levantine Neolithic
farming culture, and a southern Nilo-Sudanic pastoralist culture.  From the
pastoralists came the skills of cattle husbandry and the spiritual/religious
basis of Egyptian society; from the farmers came the barley and wheat
cultivation that formed the economic base.

In 8500 BCE, Sahara extended 400km further south than today, and was similarly
uninhabited.  Between 8500 and 5000 BCE, the Sahara was much wetter due to
different Monsoon patterns; it was inhabited plains.  The Nile valley itself was
uninhabitable during this time, due to marshy conditions and hazardous
unpredictable flooding. The plains dwellers were pastoralists with domesticated
livestock, in particular cattle.  They did not seem to have any cultivated
plants, but they had pottery.  They constructed megaliths that predated
Stonehenge by about 2000 years; these were some of the world's first
astronomical devices.

When the monsoons stopped in 5000 BCE, some of these pastoralists
migrated south, to form the basis of southern Nilotic cattle pastoralism
(which in turn spread to most of sub-Saharan Africa), and some migrated to
the Nile valley.

The Lower Nile delta is close to the Levant not only in distance, but also in
culture and technology.  By 4000 BCE there was a well established farming
population, that had also spread south to the Nile valley.

Kings and Dynasties
-------------------
The political system of ancient Egypt was always an absolute monarchy, usually
semi-divine.  The king[1] was the guarantor of stability and the defender
against chaos.  Groupings of kings, called _Dynasties_, were used since
ancient times to describe Egypt's chronology. Dynasties
represent lineages of kings, connected by family relations as well as the
location of their seat of power.  Some dynasties (especially those in the
stable Kingdom periods) last a long time; some dynasties (especially those
in the less-stable Intermediate periods) were quite short.

Later authors have grouped these dynasties into well-established _Periods_.
_Periods_ are conceptual groupings of Egypt's history; the most familiar of
these are the _Old Kingdom_, _Middle Kingdom_, and _New Kingdom_.  Each of
these has coherent aspects that we'll describe.

| Period           | Dates (BCE) | Dynasties |
|:-----------------|:-----------:|:---------:|
| Pre-dynastic     | 3600 - 3100 |  0        |
| Early Dynastic   | 3100 - 2700 |  1 - 2    |
| Old Kingdom      | 2700 - 2200 |  3 - 6    |
| 1st Intermediate | 2200 - 2000 |  7 - 11   |
| Middle Kingdom   | 2000 - 1700 | 11 - 14   |
| 2nd Intermediate | 1700 - 1500 | 15 - 17   |
| New Kingdom      | 1500 - 1100 | 18 - 20   |
| 3rd Intermediate | 1100 - 700  | 21 - 25   |
| Late Period      |  700 - 300  | 26 - 31   |


<footnote>
[1] "Pharaoh" is a Hellenized term that originally referred to the place that
the king resided; it wasn't until c 1500 BCE that it started to be applied to
the king himself.  "King" is thus more generically applicable.  Interestingly,
even in this cases of female monarchs, the term "king" was used.
</footnote>

### The Pre-dynastic Period (3600 - 3100 BCE)

Starting around 3600 BCE, Egyptian society rapidly advanced towards a complex,
refined civilization.  Farming villages developed, merged, conquered, and
unified, resulting in greater and greater sized units.  During this time they
discovered copper and metallurgy, started long distance trade, and established
commercial and military centers.  It became a loosely bound set of regional
warring and cooperating proto-states, which occasionally gained brief
ascendency or unification, but never with any solidity.  By 3200 BCE Egypt had
developed sophisticated writing, art, religion, and politics.  

### The Early Dynastic Period (3100 - 2700 BCE)

The Upper Nile developed faster, and in c. 3100 BCE the Upper Egyptian King
Narmer conquered Lower Egypt, unifying the two kingdoms.  Many hallmarks of
Egyptian culture arose during this period, such as art, architecture, and
religion (including the Pharaoh being a divine god-king).  Many of these
elements would remain nearly constant for the next 3000 years.

### The Old Kingdom (2700 - 2200 BCE)

Arts and architecture flourished in the Old Kingdom, and pyramids reached their
height with the Great Pyramid Complex at Giza (including the Sphinx).  While
not expansionist, they grew to have political, military, and economic influence
over Canaan, Nubia, and Punt.  Towards the end of the Old Kingdom, regional
nobles grew in power and challenged the central authority.  Rule
became increasingly fragmented, until finally a
massive draught brought famine and ended the dynasty, and the Old Kingdom.[2]

![Old Kingdom Map][]

<footnote>
[2]  This was exacerbated by the long-lived Pharaoh Pepi II, who lived for 100
years and reigned for 94.  He outlived his nominal heirs (and theirs as well),
throwing the line of succession into doubt.
</footnote>

### The First Intermediate Period (2200 - 2000)

As the Old Kingdom crumbled, separate kingdoms developed in Lower and Upper
Egypt.  Nubia and the Sinai broke away.  Architecture declined significantly;
very few monumental buildings were built, and those were smaller, simpler, and
cruder. Internal strife and religious conflict led to many architectural and
artistic works being defaced or destroyed. Eventually, Theban kings from the
south (Upper Egypt) conquered Lower Egypt, re-asserting control and unification.

### The Middle Kingdom (2000 - 1700 BCE)

The new 11th Dynasty quickly re-established control over all of Egypt, as well
as its former possessions of Sinai and Nubia up to the second cataract.[3]  They
built canals, forts, and other infrastructure, establishing secure border
defenses.  The rulers of the Middle Kingdom were not particularly expansionist,
although they sent diplomatic and trade expeditions to Punt and the Levant.
However, incursions from Libya diverted the kings' attention, which allowed
rebellion to grow in the heartland.  In this turmoil, invaders from western
Asia conquered much of Lower Egypt and established the Hyksos dynasty,[4]
splintering Egypt once again.

<footnote>
[3] Nubian troops -- famed for their skill with the bow -- formed an elite corps
of Egyptian troops.
<br />
[4] The Hyksos brought, amongst other technological innovations, the horse and
chariot, which changed Egyptian warfare forever.
</footnote>


### The Second Intermediate Period (1700 - 1500 BCE)

The Hyksos invasion split Egypt once again.  The Hyksos kings ruled the north,
while the remnants of the Egyptian kings ruled two independent kingdoms in
the middle and the south.  The Nubian Kush empire expanded from the south, pushing
up against the southern borders of Upper Egypt.
Initially, the kings of southern Upper Egypt maintained cordial if wary
relations with the Hyksos kings in Lower Egypt.  Eventually, Upper Egypt grew
in strength and expelled the Hyksos kings, unifying Egypt.


### The New Kingdom (1500 - 1100 BCE)

Under the New Kingdom, Egypt reached the height of its power and prosperity.
Immediately after unification, the kings expanded their territory deep into
Nubia (to the fork at modern-day Khartoum) and the Levant, forming a strategic
buffer around their core territory.  Their conquests continued into Syria,
including modern day Lebanon.

At this zenith, the singular king Amenhotep IV ascended the throne.  He devised a
new religion which worshipped only the solar disk _aten_ as the only god.  This
was the first recorded monotheism.  In his fervor, he changed his name to
Akhenaten, moved the capital from Thebes, and forbid the worship of the traditional
gods.  During his reign art and culture flourished, but little attention was
paid to external affairs. After his death, the powerful and scorned priests of
Amen re-established the original religion.  

This period of neglect of foreign affairs allowed a new major power to arise.
The Hittites pushed south from Anatolia, conquering much of the Levant.  For
much of the late New Kingdom, Egypt and the Hittites vied for control of this
region.

Around 1200 BCE, the invasion of the [Sea Peoples][] was causing the downfall
of many other Bronze Age empires; however the great Ramesses III defeated them,
settling them as subject peoples.  This likely includes the Philistines being
settled into Canaan.[5]  The
cost of these wars (and wars against Libyan tribesmen) strained the state;
this -- combined with environmental change that lead to draught and famine -- led
to the downfall of the New Kingdom.

![New Kingdom Map][]

<footnote>
[5] The Philistines may have been a proto-Greek people.
</footnote>

### The Third Intermediate Period (1100 - 700 BCE) and Late Period (700 - 300 BCE)

As the New Kingdom disintegrated, various other powers capitalized on the
power vacuum and conquered part (and sometimes all) of Egypt.  Libyans were
followed by Nubians who were followed by Assyrians and then various forms of
Persians.

### The Graeco-Roman period (300 BCE - 600 CE)

About 300 BCE Alexander the Great conquered the Persian Empire, including
Egypt.  After his death, his general Ptolemy claimed Egypt, establishing the
Ptolemaic Kingdom.  The ruling dynasty was culturally Greek and Greek became
the language of government, but they progressively "Egyptianized" over time.
It was a time of great power and culture, until Cleopatra[6] and
the famous Roman annexation.

As a Roman province, Egypt was afforded a special status that allowed a greater
degree of self-government and independence.  When Rome split into the Eastern
and Western empires in 400 CE, Egypt was given to the Eastern empire (Byzantium).
Around 600 CE, it was conquered by the surging Arab Islamic wave.  Although the
ruling Caliphate changed, it has stayed in this sphere until the present day.

<footnote>
[6] Cleopatra was ethnically Greek, but she was the first Ptolemaic
Pharaoh to speak Egyptian.
</footnote>

Writing
-------
Everyone is familiar with _hieroglyphics_, but there were in fact three different
writing systems in ancient Egypt.  The first hieroglyphs appeared c. 4000 BCE
as fragmentary writing, but it was not until c. 3300 BCE that they evolved into
a full written language.  For a long time, people thought that hieroglyphs were
all pictographic, that is each symbol corresponded to a word or concept.  This
is true for some hieroglyphs, but some represent sounds, and these sounds are
used to build up words phonetically (like in English).  Additionally, some hieroglyphs
were grammatical markers.

![Hieroglyphs][]

Hieroglyphics were well suited for carving on stone, but an alternative cursive
script called _hieratic_ developed concurrently to write on papyrus.  It was
derived from hieroglyphics, but looks quite different.

![Hieratic Script][]

While hieratic script was developed at the same time as hieroglyphics, in the
Late Period (around 600 BCE) a new script _demotic_ was developed and became
the standard.

![Demotic Script][]

Architecture and the Afterlife
-------------------------------
The architecture Egypt is intimately connected to their gods,
funerary rites, and conception of the afterlife.  Up until the Pre-dynastic
period, their architecture was similar to many other neolithic societies.
In the earliest times, people were buried in
sand pits in the desert, which did a remarkable job at preserving their bodies.
One
notable thing is that they buried their dead not just with items to denote their
status, but also with many mundane items like food and sewing needles.  

In the Early Dynastic Period, the elite began to be buried in
[mastabas][Mastaba], square buildings that preceded pyramids.  Mastabas had a
"viewing" chamber in the building above ground, with scenes honoring their
occupant.  A shaft led to an underground burial chamber in which were placed
the body and the possessions that would accompany them into the afterlife.  It
was believed that the body needed to be preserved -- and necessities like food
and drink provided -- for eternity, otherwise the body with wither and the
spirit (_ka_) would become unrooted.

![Mastaba][MastabaPic]

The transition from mastabas to pyramids marks the start of the Old Kingdom[7].
Djoser (first king of the Fourth Dynasty) constructed his famous step pyramid,
which architecturally was a sequence of progressively smaller mastabas built on
top of each other.[8]

![The Step Pyramid of Djoser][]

This marked a turning point in noble burials.  The king was divine and needed
to be housed in a suitably impressive structure, and the priests and people of
Egypt were responsible for making offerings for eternity, sustaining the king
in the afterlife.  Surrounding the pyramid was a grand temple compound devoted
to the exaltation and veneration of the dead king.

Subsequent kings of the Old Kingdom also built impressive
pyramids, although there was a learning curve.  Sneferu's first pyramid
collapsed, and his second pyramid (aka "The Bent Pyramid") had to change angle
halfway to avoid collapsing.  He finally succeeded with his third pyramid,
the Red Pyramid.

![Collapsed Pyramid of Meidum][]
![The Bent Pyramid][]
![The Red Pyramid][]

Egypt's most famous skyline is the Great Pyramid Complex at Giza, which
includes not only the Great Pyramid of King Khufu (c. 2600 BCE), but the
slightly-less-great-but-still-really-impressive pyramid of his son Khafra,
several smaller pyramids of their sons, grandsons, and wives, the Great Sphinx,
and multiple magnificent temples.  This Fourth Dynasty represents peak pyramid
for Egypt; later kings expended fewer resources in their pyramids.

![Great Pyramid Complex at Giza][]

During the Old Kingdom pyramids were inviolate, but as royal power weakened
leading to the First Intermediate Period, the complexes were raided, and the
sacred remains despoiled.  Perhaps because of this, by the Middle Kingdom kings
would have a ceremonial pyramid but bury their bodies in tombs cut
into the rocks of cliff walls, often in secret locations.  This may also be why
the pyramids of this period were less grandiose.  By the New Kingdom, Egyptians
had stopped building pyramids in favor of these rock tombs, but the temples had
grown increasingly magnificent.  Rameses II was a particularly prolific
(and narcissistic) builder, both of temples and of large statues of
himself.  He was so prolific that the majority of ancient Egyptian structures
that remain today were built by him.

<footnote>
[7] It really is just this.  Djoser was related to the preceding Pharaoh, the
capital was in the same city, the culture was the same.  But the archaeology
became much more interesting!
<br>
[8] The architect behind this most iconic tradition was [Imhotep][Imhotep], the
original renaissance man.  He is considered the first recorded architect,
engineer, and physician.  Born a commoner, he was worshipped as a god for
thousands of years.
</footnote>


Art, Culture, and Society
-------------------------
Despite ancient Egyptian history lasting 4000 years, the hallmarks of culture
were remarkably constant, pointing to a deeply conservative society.
Compare, for example, an art piece from 3500 BCE and that from
1300 BCE.

![Narmer Palette][]
![Nebamun Painting][]

Consider the elements common to both the first piece and the second: people's
pose, flat aspect, use of size as representation of importance, etc.  This
is despite an intervening span of over 2000 years!  Similarly, throughout
these times, the king was always an semi-divine absolute theocratic monarch,
the gods evolved over time but maintained their fundamental characteristics,
and people were embalmed and mummified in similar fashions.  In fact, even
after the Romans conquered Egypt, their expats would get mummified after their
death!  Strong was the pull of Egyptian culture.

Another aspect worthy of note was the position of women.  Egyptian culture was
very progressive towards women, unlike other ancient civilizations (and some
modern ones).  Women could own land, receive inheritance, own businesses, and
engage in commercial transactions.  Unlike Greece, they could walk where they
pleased unaccompanied.  They were also equal before the law, were able to be
priests (until the New Kingdom), and on four separate occasions were the
rulers of Egypt.

Egyptians were famed from earliest times for their doctors.  We have found
many medical texts dating from 3000 BCE.  While some are a bit magical for
modern medical tastes, others include poultices and procedures (such as
draining abscesses, etc) that are recognized as effective today.  Even rulers of
distant empires would employ Egyptian doctors.  It is hypothesized that the
intimate anatomical knowledge Egyptians gained from their embalming procedures
formed the basis of their medical development.

Summary
-------
Egypt was one of the two founding cultures of the fertile crescent, and was
a dominant cultural, economic, political, and military force until being
absorbed into the Roman empire.  For almost 4000 years it cycled between
unification and internal conflict, but it never ceased being the object
of envy and admiration.  Even its conquerers were seduced by its culture,
often become more Egyptian than the natives.
