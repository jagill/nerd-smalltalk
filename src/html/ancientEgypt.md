Ancient Egypt
=============
How did the civilization of Ancient Egypt start?  When did it end, or did it?
What's the difference between the Old Kingdom and the New Kingdom?  We've
all grown up with images of Ancient Egypt in our heads, but with precious few
details of this amazing civilization.  This NST will lay a framework for the
evolution of land that has borne countless people, cities, and cultures for
over 6,000 years.

Dynasties
---------

* King/Pharaoh always focal point of power.
  * Predynastic times, names of gods were mentioned, but only kings had pictures
  * Defender of order vs Chaos
* Remarkably conservative culture.  Over 3000 years:
  * One form of government
  * One form of (admittedly evolving) religion
  * One style of art
  * One style of funerary rite
* Chronology is recorded via Dynasties of Pharaohs
  * Multi-generation, related by kinship and location
  * Some are quite long, some are short.

The Nile
--------
Egypt was called the "Gift of the Nile" for the many
favorable attributes of the river.  It allowed easy transport: going downstream was
easy due to the current, but the dominant wind blew from the north, facilitating
sailing upstream.  It was very fertile: regular flooding[1] provided
predictable irrigation and fertilization, augmented by ample sunlight.  And the
desert to the east was rich in gold.

The Nile flows north from Khartoum (in current Sudan)
approximately 3000 km to the Nile Delta, draining into the Mediterranean.
Upstream/south of Khartoum the Nile splits into the Blue
Nile (which sources from Ethiopia) and the White Nile (which comes Lake Victoria
and further south).  Between Khartoum and the Mediterranean are six cataracts
that impede
navigation; there have often been military and/or commercial checkpoints at
the cataracts.  Ancient Egypt is based on the portion of the Nile between the
first cataract (at Aswan) and the Mediterranean.  South of Aswan lies the land
called Nubia or Kush.

Egypt was divided geographically and politically into Lower Egypt and Upper
Egypt[2].  Lower (northern) Egypt was centered in the Nile Delta, it had wide
expanses of arable (and sometimes swampy) land, access to the Mediterranean
and closer cultural connections with the Levant.  Modern Cairo and ancient
Memphis sit at the strategic point where the Nile fans
out into the delta.  Upper (southern) Egypt was in
the Nile Valley, a narrow (~1 mile) wide strip of arable land around the Nile.
Ancient Thebes and Luxor sit in Upper Egypt.

<footnote>
[1] The Nile flooded predictably; in fact the Egyptian calendar was divided into
three seasons: flooding, emergence (and planting), and harvest.

[2] They even had different [crowns][CrownsOfEgypt].

The Neolithic
-------
Neolithic Egypt was the product of two cultures, a northern Levantine Neolithic
farming culture, and a southern Nilo-Sudanic pastoralist culture.  From
the pastoralists came the skills of cattle husbandry and the
spiritual/religious basis of Egyptian society; from the farmers came the
barley and wheat cultivation that formed the economic base.

In 8500 BCE, Sahara extended 400km further south than today, and was similarly
uninhabited.  Between 8500
and 5300 BCE, the Sahara was much wetter due to different Monsoon patterns;
it was inhabited plains.  The Nile valley itself was uninhabitable during
this time, due to marshy conditions and hazardous unpredictable flooding.
The plains dwellers were pastoralists with domesticated
livestock, in particular cattle.  They did not seem to have any cultivated
plants.  The had pottery, and made some of the world's first astronomical
devices.  These were megaliths that predated Stonehenge by about 2000 years.

When the monsoons stopped in 5300 BCE, some of these pastoralists
migrated south, to form the basis of southern Nilotic cattle pastoralism
(which in turn spread to most of sub-Saharan Africa), and some migrated to
the Nile valley.

The Lower Nile delta is close to the Levant not only in distance, but also in
culture and technology.  By 4000 BCE there was a well established farming
population, that had also spread south to the Nile valley.

Nubia
-----
* Populated by Badari pastoralists and also populations from Sudan, culturally and
genetically very close to early Upper Egypt.
* Noted as excellent archers, often used as elite corps in Egyptian army.
* Which stages was it a tributary state?  When a significant partner (eg
Middle Kingdom)?
* Middle Kingdom, Kushites were a significant part of Egypt.
* Kushite pharaohs in Iron Age, fighting with Assyrians.
* Eventually conquered by Christian Empire of Axum (ie, Ethiopia).
* Group A, Meroë, etc.
* Had similar religion and cultural practices originally, gods evolved
differently over time.
* Had pyramids!  Show pictures.


The Pre-dynastic Period
-----------------------
Starting around 3600 BCE, Egyptian society rapidly advanced towards a complex,
refined civilization.  farming
villages developed, merged, conquered, and unified, resulting in greater and
greater sized units.  During this time they discovered copper and metallurgy,
started long distance trade, and established commercial and
military centers.

While political and technological development continued in all parts of the
Nile, the Upper Nile grew increasingly politically
sophisticated, forming eleven generations of kings called "Dynasty 0".  These
kinds eventually conquered the north (Lower Nile) and
continued their military expansion into the Levant.  Lower Nubia became a
tributary state as well.  By 3200 BCE Egypt had very developed
writing, art, religion, and politics.  It was a loosely bound set of regional
warring and cooperating proto-states, which occasionally gained brief ascendency
or unification, but never with any solidity.


The Early Dynastic Period
-------------------------
Egypt became unified c. 3100 BCE, when
King Narmer is shown wearing the crowns both of Upper and Lower Egypt.  Many
hallmarks of Egyptian culture arose during this period, such as art,
architecture, and religion (including the Pharaoh
being a divine god-king).  Many of these elements would remain constant for the
next 3000 years.  The elite began to be buried in [mastabas][Mastaba], square
buildings that preceded pyramids.

The Old Kingdom
---------------
The reign of Pharaoh Djoser is taken to be the start of the Old Kingdom
(2700 - 2200 BCE), because
he built the first pyramid.[3]  Djoser constructed his famous step
pyramid, which architecturally was a sequence of progressively smaller mastabas
built on top of each other.[4]

Arts and architecture flourished in the Old Kingdom, and pyramids reached their
height with the Great Pyramid Complex at Giza (including the Sphinx).

While not expansionist, they grew to have political, military, and economic
influence over Canaan, Nubia, and Punt.  Regional nobles grew in power,
challenging the central authority.  The final Pharaoh was the long lived Pepi II,
who lived for 100 years and reigned for 94.  Rule became increasingly fragmented
towards the end of his reign, until finally a massive draught brought famine and
ended the dynasty, and the Old Kingdom.

<footnote>
[3] It really is just this.  Djoser was related to the preceding Pharaoh, the
capital was in the same city, the culture was the same.  But the archaeology
became much more interesting!
<br>
[4] The architect behind this most iconic tradition was [Imhotep][Imhotep], the
original renaissance man.  He is considered the first architect, engineer, and
physician.  Born a commoner, he was worshipped as a god for thousands of years.
