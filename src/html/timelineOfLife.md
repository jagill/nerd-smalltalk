Earth's Formations and Pre-Life
-------------------------------

The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago (BYA), and shortly thereafter at
around 4.5 BYA the Moon was formed, likely due to an impact with Mars-sized
planet dubbed Theia.  The eon between Earth's formation and 4 BYA is called the
Hadean Eon, and Earth was mostly molten and volcanic, although there is
evidence of water.

The next Eon, the Archean Eon, lasted from 4 BYA to 2.5 BYA.  There was almost
no free oxygen, although there was prevelant water.  By the end of the Archean,
the first continents were formed.  Life began in the Archaen, around 3.8-3.7
BYA, recorded in Banded Iron Formations.  At 3.5 BYA, the Bacteria and the
Archaea split.  At 3 BYA, photosynthesizing cyanobacteria
form, and start to produce oxygen.

TLDR:
4 BYA Life happened.

Pre-Animal Life
---------------

The Proterozoic Eon comprises of 2.5 BYA to 0.5 BYA, and sets the stage --
through oxygenation and experimentation -- for the complex life in the Cambrian
and beyond.  The cyanobacteria (and later eukaryotes) produced oxygen, which is
toxic to many bacteria and archaea.  This caused the first great extinction
event.  However, oxygen allows a much more efficient use of energy, allowing
organisms which take advantage of it to become more complex, including
Eukaryotes and eventually multi-cellular organisms.

The first evidence of eukaryotes occurs 2 BYA, they became structurally
complex around 1.5 BYA, and developed sexual reproduction around 1 BYA.
Around 750 million years ago (MYA), Eukaryotes become more modern with
Paramecia and Amoeba appearing.  This is also when the first differentiation
between plant-like and animal-like cells evolves.

Viruses (specifically, Bacteriophages) appear about the time of the Eukaryote
split, perhaps 2 BYA.

Throughout the Proterozoic, various multi-cellular (or at least collective)
life forms get their start, but only at the very end do the ancestors of
current multi-cellular organisms start appearing.  One of the most famous of
this is the "Ediacaran Experiment" (575 MYA), which occurs shortly after a
period of global glaciation dubbed "Snowball Earth".  The earliest fungi also
appear at this time.

TLDR:
2 BYA Eukaryotes evolved, and viruses appeared.
1 BYA First time anything had sex.
Oxygen killed most things but those that could use it got great power.

The Start of "Modern" Life
--------------------------
The Paleozoic Era (550 to 250 MYA) set the stage for modern life as we know it.
It is comprised of six periods:

The Cambrian Period (550-500 MYA) witnessed the Cambrian Explosion, when the
first emergence of multi-cellular life resulted in virtually all major phyla of
animals, as well as many things that suggest evolution was either drunk or
wicked cool.  Google for Cambrian images, you won't be disappointed.

The Ordovician Period (500-450 MYA) saw the first primitive fish evolve, and
land was first colonized by athropods.  The sea was filled with invertebrates,
including many that would be familiar to us today.  Unfortunately, at the very
end of the Ordovician was the first global mass extinction, when 60% of marine
invertebrates went extinct due to another rendition of Snowball Earth.

The Silurian Period (450-400 MYA) led a brisk recovery, seeing jawed fish and
freshwater fish evolve, as well as fully terrestrial life (arachnids,
centipedes, funghi, vascular plants).

The Devonian Period (400-350 MYA) was known as "The Age of Fish", because fish
radiated immensely and became dominant.  On land, trees and seeded plants
evolved, along with amphibians.  The Devonian ended with the second global mass
extinction.

The Carboniferous Period (350-300 MYA) was an era of swamps.  Much of our
fossil fuels come from these swamps (hence the name).  Reptiles and synapsids
(the ancestors of mammals) appeared with the evolution of the amniotic egg,
which allowed them to head inland and expand.

The final Period of this Era is the Permian (300-250 MYA), when the famed
Pangaea formed and the world dried out.  Reptiles and synapsids flourished,
although the synapsids dominated.  The famous Dimetrodon was a synapsid, and
thus more closely related to us than to dinosaurs.  Conifers evolved and
dominated the landscape.  The Permian ended with the third, and must brutal,
mass extinction -- almost 95% of all life went extinct in the event known as
"The Great Dying."

TLDR:
1/2 BYA the first animals evolved and dominated the seas.
1/3 BYA tetrapods dominated the land.
1/4 BYA (almost) everything died.

The Age of Reptiles
-------------------
The Mesozoic Era (250 to 65 MYA) spanned the time between the Permion-Triassic
extinction and the Cretaceous extinction.  It was dominated by large reptiles
such as dinosaurs, pterosaurs, ichthyosaur, and the like.  Mammals, birds, and
flowers all evolved, and most of the reptiles died out in the terminal
Cretaceous extinction.

The Triassic Period (250 to 200 MYA) was a desolate time.  Almost everything
had just died, and most of the world's land was in Pangaea, the center of which
was very arid (as it was very far from the sea).  Large sea-based reptiles
evolved, as did early dinosaurs and pterosaurs.  Crocodillians out-competed the
large amphibians that dominated freshwater.  The only synapsids that remained
were a branch of large, dominant herbivores, and a branch of small carnivores
that eventually evolved into mammals.  Mosquitoes also arose.  Temperature and
humidity increased, favoring many reptiles, but caused the Triassic-Jurassic
extinction event.  Amongst many other groups, the large synapsids and most
forms of crocodillians died out in this event.

The Jurassic Period (200 to 150 MYA) was dominated by dinosaurs and other large
reptiles, including the famous Stegosaurus and the long-necked Sauropods liked
the Brontosaurus. The first mammals evolved, but were very small.  Pangaea
broke up, which caused the Jurrasic-Cretaceous extinction.

The Cretaceous Period (150 to 65 MYA) had most of the iconic dinosaurs.  T-Rex
and Triceratops evolved, as did birds and flowers.  The climate grew steadily
colder and more seasonal, and Pangaea finished breaking up into our present
continents.  Unfortunately, a large asteroid hit the Earth at the end of the
Cretaceous and killed all the (non-bird) dinosaurs.

TLDR:
200 MYA Dinosaurs and reptiles ruled for a long time.
50 MYA An asteroid killed everything big, but not tiny mammals or birds.


The Age of Mammals
------------------
The Cenozoic Era (65 MYA to present) witnessed the transformation of the world
from a recently-depopulated dense jungle to cooler continents dominated by
grasslands and temperate forests.  With all the large reptiles dead, mammals
and birds thrived and dominated.  The continents moved into their current
positions, and humans arose.

The Paleogene (65 to 25 MYA) saw life recover from the Cretaceous extinction
event.  Sharks replaced reptiles as the rulers of the sea, to be replaced
themselves by carniverous whales.  The jungles were slowly replaced with
grassland and forests, leading to a brief reign of large flightess birds
followed by mammals of diverse forms.  By the end of the Paleogene, almost all
major orders of modern mammals and plants had evolved. Marsupials dominated
South America, Antartica, and Australia, which only disconnected towards the
latter part of the Paleogene.

The Neogene (25 to 3 MYA) saw the contents move into their current positions,
and the beginnings of the important modern climactic features, like monsoons
and the Sahara desert.  As North and South America collided, the marsupials
of the south and the placental mammals of the north collided, generally to
the detriment of the marsupials.  Australopithecus, the beginnings of the
human branch, evolved at the end of the Neogene.

The Quaternary (3 MYA to present) saw the arrival of the (most recent) Ice Age,
with four major glaciation events with ice caps advancing as far as 40N
latitude (approximately Philadelphia or Madrid).  Approximately 200 thousand
years ago (200 KYA) anatomically modern Homo Sapiens developed, and about
50 KYA humans developed modern cognition.  The last glaciation ended 12
thousand years ago (12 KYA), ushering in the Holocene, which is the
interglacial period of the Ice Age in which we live.  It contains all of
recorded human history.  This is also about the time of a massive extinction of
all large mammals on almost all continents, Africa being the exception.

TLDR:
25 MYA Most forms of mammals had evolved.
3 MYA The current ice age started
12 KYA The most recent glaciation ended, human history begins

Summary
-------
Shortly after the planet formed, life began.  It took about half of Earth's
history to produce eukaryotic life, and 7/8ths to produce animals.  After
that, it was a quick 500 million years to cycle through all life that
you would recognize.  Reptiles (including dinosaurs) dominated for 200
million years before being killed by a meteor, leading to 65 million years
of mammalian domination.  First first ancestors of the human branch arose
3 to 2 million years ago, leading to humans 200 thousand years ago.  Everything
that humans have recorded has occured in the last 10 thousand years.
