Ancient Greece
==============
We all know that the Greeks gave us democracy, oratory, theater, logic, and
a tradition of sculpture unrivaled for two thousand years.
But where did they come from?  How did Rome conquer them?  How do Troy,
Alexander, and the chiseled abs of _300_ fit into this story?


Minoan Civilization
-------------------
### 3500 BCE - 1500 BCE

The story of the Greeks starts with the non-Greek Minoans of Crete.  Perhaps
the inspiration for Plato's Atlantis, they had advanced agriculture, arts,
architecture, pottery, and fashion[1].  Master sea-farers, they dominated the trade
routes of the Mediterranean starting 2000 BCE.  The Greek islands -- and parts
of the mainland -- were under their cultural sway, and often political
dominion.  At points they exacted Greek youths (male and female) as yearly tribute;
these might have been forced to participate in the Minoan bull festivals.  These
early form of bullfighting were far more dangerous to the humans than the bulls,
and may be the basis of the myth of Perseus and the Minotaur.

Around 1500 BCE, their civilization was shook by a massive volcanic eruption and
went into decline.  The Greek Mycenaeans conquered them in their weakened state,
inhabiting their palaces and taking over their trade routes.

Mycenaeans
---------
### 1500 - 1100 BC

The Mycenaeans comprise the first major Greek civilization, and the ones
described in the Trojan War.  Warlike and able
traders, they overthrew their Minoan masters, controlled their major cities, and
adopted much of their cultural sophistication, including writing[2].  The Mycenaeans
period provides the semi-historical basis for many of the myths of ancient
Greece, including the Trojan Horse, Odysseus, Achilles, Hercules, Jason
and the Argonauts, Perseus, and Theseus.

The Mycenaeans did things on a grand scale.  They traded from the Black Sea to
Iberia, with secondary trade to the British Isles and the Baltic.  They had advanced
industry and record keeping -- their writings recount organized groups of
hundreds of workers producing the same goods, and describe the classification of
quality of wool from flocks of hundreds of thousand of sheep.  They expanded to
have direct control of many Mediterranean islands and colonies on Asia Minor,
meddling with the Hittites and being described by them on the same level as
the Egyptians, Assyrians, or Babylonians.  Their elite were buried with immense
treasure, their palaces were vast, and their fortresses had massive walls constructed
from stone blocks so large that the later Greeks said only a cyclops could have moved
them.

![Citadel of Mycenae][]

Their end was abrupt, and the cause is debated.  The most popular theory is the
invasion of the Doric tribes (also a Greek people) or the Sea Peoples.  Whatever
the cause, in less than 100 years all evidence of trade, wealth, literacy, art, culture,
architecture, and political organization disappeared, ushering in the Greek Dark
Ages.

[2] In this period they used Linear B (derived from Minoan Linear A), which is
unrelated to the more familiar Greek alphabet.

Dark Ages
---------
### 1100 - 800 BCE

After collapse of Mycenaeans, new Greek peoples[3] migrated (or invaded), resulting
in the cultural and political fragmentation of the Greek peninsula.
Long distance trade vanished, major building ceased, and literacy was lost.
The rough terrain of Greece -- rugged hills, valleys, and bays -- meant each
city initially developed in relative isolation.  Development brought local political
unification, but embedded in the culture was a fierce independent streak.

<footnote>
[3] The major invading tribes were the Dorians (who settled in the Peloponnese),
the Ionians (who settled in Attica, around Athens), and the Aeolians (who settled
in Thessaly).

Early Greece
---------
### 800 - 500 BCE

Eventually, the Greeks became masters of the Mediterranean again, contesting the
dominant power of Phoenicia.  Rivalry did not prevent them from adopting (and
adapting) the Phoenician writing system, so in this period written records
appear once again.  The Greek colonies ranged from eastern Iberia, Marseilles, Sicily,
southeastern Italy (dubbed "Greater Greece"), western Asia Minor, Cyprus,
Rhodes, Byzantium, and the southern and eastern coast of the Black Sea.  This
commercial empire was aided by the concept of coins, which they adopted from
Lydia.

In addition to the commercial flourishing, there was also a great cultural and
intellectual awakening.  The great scholars of Greece went to Babylon to learn
science, math, and astronomy; from the Egyptians they learned medicine.
Literature and theater arose, including our fundamental division between tragedy
and comedy.

Amongst the many Greek city-states, Athens and Sparta grew pre-eminent.  By
diplomacy, commerce, and force, they amassed significant power; the Spartans
had their alliance of land powers called the Peloponnesian League, and Athens
controlled much of the surrounding seas and commerce.

The Persian Wars
---------
### 500 - 475 BCE

Greeks at this time were still considered a backwater by the
"important" empires of the fertile crescent, in particular the Persian.
Many city-states in western Asia Minor were culturally and economically
tied to Greece, but were under the political sway of Persia.  Some rebelled and
were ultimately squashed, but not before several Greek city-states aided them.
This drew the ire of Persia, who sent a great expedition to conquer and punish
Greece for its insolence.  After several initial victories, the
bulk of the Persian fleet was destroyed in a storm.  Over the next 25 years,
a series of invasions from Persia -- including Marathon and Thermopylae
(as famously if "creatively" depicted in _300_) -- were beaten back by the
Greeks.

The Greeks pursued their victory, gaining stronger footholds in
Asia Minor and destroying the remaining naval power of the Persians.  This
established the Greeks as a major player in the
Mediterranean.  The success of the Greeks over the vast numerical and
financial superiority of the Persian armies is viewed by many as the triumph
of free citizens fighting for their homeland over conscripted slave-armies,
fighting on foreign shores for their ruler's avarice.  Others focus on the
advancements the Greeks made in armor and tactics.

Athens and Sparta
---------
### 475 - 350 BCE

After the defeat of Persia, a period of uneasy peace between the Greek city-states
arises.  Athens becomes a major naval, economic, and political power; it is in
this period that Athenian democracy matured -- and was exported -- under the
famous Pericles.  It also founded the Delian League, an alliance rivaling the
military power of Sparta's Peloponnesian League.

Tensions simmer with the military dictatorship of Sparta, and then erupt into
the Peloponnesian wars.  These wars were a complicated sequence of shifting
allegiances, truces, and betrayals.  Athens dominates early, but after several
climactic battles and missed opportunities, Sparta gains the upper hand.  A
grinding decade of war, with the decisive intervention of a resurgent Persia
on the side of Sparta, led to total defeat of Athens around 400 BCE.

Sparta emerged victorious, but the next half-century was a chaotic period of
city-states warring with each other, as well as the old foe Persia and the new
power Carthage.  Somehow in the midst of this, some of Greece's greatest artists,
playwrights, philosophers, and scientists arose, including Socrates, Plato, and
Aristotle.

Age of Alexander
---------
### 350 - 200 BCE

Into this chaotic scene came Philip II, king of the near-barbarian borderland
of Macedon.  After consolidating his power and quelling neighboring regions, he
became a major power in Greece.  A request for aid from one of the warring
sides in the Grecian wars gave an excuse to successively "liberate"
city-states, until he ruled all of Greece.  He stationed Macedonian divisions
all over Greece, partly to cement his rule and partly to prepare for a great
invasion of Persia.

Philip was unexpectedly assassinated, leaving his son, Alexander III, the
throne.  Alexander (already an accomplished military commander at 20) quashed
rebellions in Greece, then marched into Asia Minor.  By all accounts an inspiring
leader, a daring tactician, and a brilliant strategist, he quickly conquered
Anatolia, the Levant, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Media, and Persia.  As his conquests grew, so did
his ambitions, and he marched into the wild lands of Central Asia.  He even
began to invade India, but his army refused to march any further.

Returning to Babylon, his new capital, he began the political, administrative,
and economic organization of his empire.  He died of a sudden illness after
a night of feasting and drinking (some allege poison).  At his death at the
age of 33, he was undefeated in battle, having created one of the greatest and
largest empires in history.

![Empire of Alexander][]

Control of his empire passed hastily to his generals, which quickly devolved into
warfare, intrigue, and assassination.  After 20 years, his empire was divided
into three main parts: the Macedonian Empire (including Greece), the Egyptian
Empire of Ptolemy, and the Seleucid Empire of Syria and Persia.  This balance of
power held until a new threat arose in the west.

![Empire after Alexander][]

Rome and After
---------
### 200 BCE and beyond

While the successors to Alexander struggled for power, a city-state far to the
west called Rome was gaining territory, wealth, and power.  Piece by piece they
ate away at former Greek holdings: colonies in Iberia and Sicily were won in
wars with Carthage, colonies in eastern Italy were conquered as part of
expansion, and partly on invitation from Greece pirates in Illyria were defeated
and their lands annexed.  However, it was in the final Punic war against
Carthage that Rome reached ascendency.  Philip V of Macedon allied with the
Carthaginians and declared war against Rome.  After defeating Carthage, Rome
conquered the Macedonian Empire in punishment.  Greece fell under the Roman
sphere until the conquest of the Byzantine Empire by the Turks, around 1400 CE.

As Rome expanded, it also conquered Ptolemaic Egypt, the Levant, and the
western part of the Seleucid/Persian empire.  The remains of the Persian
Empire stood on Rome's eastern border, until the Islamic conquest shortly after
600 CE.

Epilogue
--------
Rising from the remains of the Minoans and Mycenaeans, ancient Greece not only
grew in commercial and military power, but became for a millennium the
intellectual leader of the western hemisphere.  Even its conquerers were in awe;
Macedonian rulers revered Athens despite its constant rebellions, and in
Rome Greek tutors were in the highest demand.  It also brought a radical new type of
government -- democracy -- into the world, although it survived only a short while.
Through Alexander, Hellenic influence in government, philosophy, science, and
the arts spread from Iberia to Egypt to India.  And of course, it provided one
of the fundamental pillars of western civilization.
