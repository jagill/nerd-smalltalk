Early Human Migrations
======================
Once humans were confined to Africa, yet now they are all over the world.  The
story of how this came to be is complex and fascinating, involving many waves
of migration, conquest, and intermarriage.  In this NST, we'll talk about the
major human migrations of the Stone Age.  We'll also talk about several later
ones (e.g. the Polynesians) which are important to know.  After reading this
note, you should know roughly how and when each major population group
got to their ancestral home.


In the beginning
----------------
Before about 50 thousand years ago (KYA), _Homo Sapiens_ occupied most of
Africa, and sometimes part of the
[Levant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant).  Although anatomically modern,
their lifestyle differed very little from their predecessors or contemporaries,
like _H neanderthalis_ or _H erectus_.  Neanderthals occupied the bulk of
Europe and some of Asia, while _H erectus_ occupied much of Asia, including
insular South-East Asia.

This time was during a glaciation period; correspondingly the sea levels were
significantly lower than today.  This changed the coastlines, and in particular
four major areas currently underwater were part of the continents:
  * *Doggerland* The land current under the English Channel, connecting Britain
    to mainland Europe.
  * *Sundaland* The land comprising most of insular Southeast Asia, connecting
    what is now Thailand, Malaysia, and the western islands of Indonesia.
  * *Sahul* A continent including current day Australia, New Guinea, and
    the currently submerged lands in between.
  * *Beringia* The land now covered by the Bering Strait, connecting Siberia
    with Alaska.

These were all very important paths for the Upper Paleolithic migrations.


Upper Paleolithic
-----------------
Leading up to 50 KYA, humans grew slowly more culturally and technologically
complex, but around 50 KYA something extraordinary happened.  The diversity
and sophistication of tool use exploded, and culture blossomed.  Humans
also learned to fish, opening up a whole new category of foods.

These developments allowed humans to expand (relatively) rapidly beyond Africa[1].
By 45 KYA they had expanded into Europe (nearly reaching the Arctic
circle), mainland Asia, and as far as Australia.  By 30 KYA, humans had reached
Japan and Siberia.

Many of these lands were occupied by Neanderthals, _H erectus_, or other
archaic _Homo_ populations.  Within a several thousand years of humans
arriving, these archaic populations disappeared.  The most likely hypothesis
is that they were out-competed and likely exterminated by humans, although
not before a little "genetic mixing" took place.

<footnote>
[1] One intriguing theory for this is the [Sahara Pump][SaharaPumpTheory].

Australian Migration
--------------------
The migration to Australia deserves special note.  It was a feat of daring and
amazing technological ingenuity.  The ocean level was much lower than it was
today, exposing _Sundaland_.  Between Sundaland and _Sahul_ there were sea
traversals for which the destination was
90km away, significantly beyond visual range.  Thus, these crossings involved
not only building rafts, but also sailing them into open sea.  This journey
ranks as one of the most impressive of the prehistoric world.

These explorers are the ancestors of the Australian Aborigines, as well as
populations historically called _Melanesian_, in Papua New Guinea and Solomon
Islands[2].  They were the initial settlers in other Pacific islands, such as
the Philippines and Fiji, although later Austronesian migrants contributed
heavily to the current populations.

<footnote>
[2] As we'll discuss later, the Austronesians and Polynesians come much
later from a separate migration.
</footnote>

The Americas
--------------
The arrival of humans to the Americas is an area of active research; some of
the long-held theories are being challenged by new evidence.  We'll give the
dominant view, and leave exploration of the alternative theories to the reader.

As we mentioned before, late in the Upper Paleolithic the ocean levels were
lower than they were today; one effect of this was that the Bering Strait
between Siberia and Alaska was above sea level.  This land -- called _Beringia_
-- was a bridge to the Americas.  About 20,000 BCE, a group of Central Asian
or Siberian hunter gatherers populated Beringia, but were unable to progress
further due to glaciers covering what is now Yukon and British Columbia.  As
the glaciers were receded around 12,000 BCE, an ice-free passage developed
in what is now the Northwest Territories and Alberta, east of the Rockies.
Some of the Beringian population followed this passage, possibly following
large game, and quickly spread across North America, Mesoamerica, and South
America.  All Native Americans -- excluding the Arctic peoples such as Inuit,
Alaskan Natives, etc -- are descended from this population[3].

As for the Arctic peoples, there was an initial population -- called
_Paleo-Eskimo_ -- that migrated (separate from the Native Americans) from
Siberia to North America around 4000 BCE, reaching Greenland by at least 2500
BCE.  Much later (200 BCE), the _Thule_ peoples come through Alaska and
migrated east, possibly displacing the Paleo-Eskimos along the way. The Thules
reached Greenland around 1300 CE; the Inuit and other Arctic peoples descend
from them.  The Paleo-Eskimos seem to have died out around 1500 CE without
leaving any genetics in living populations; there are several theories as to why
this might be, but nothing conclusive.

<footnote>
[3] Genetic analysis suggests that there was an additional migration from
Siberia, after the first wave but before the Arctic peoples.  This wave seems to
have eventually merged with the existing populations.  The Athabaskan/Na-Den√©
groups have the highest proportion of the genome of this proposed additional
migration.
</footnote>

Neolithic Europe
----------------
After the great human expansion, Europe was populated by hunter-gatherers.
In the Levant, however, the population had developed agriculture by 9000 BCE.
This spread to Anatolia by 8000 BCE and the Balkans by 7000 BCE.  It reached
most of Europe by 5000 BCE, and Britain by 4000 BCE.  While the extent to
which expansion was due to migration versus cultural diffusion is under
active research, it appears it was mostly due to migration close to
the Middle East, becoming increasingly due to cultural diffusion the further
it expanded.  The British neolithic farmers, for example, shared about 20% of
their genome with those in the Levant; in the Balkans the share was closer to
80%.

Neolithic societies in Europe had several common cultural and technological
elements beyond domesticated plants and animals, including pottery, timber
longhouses, and polished stone tools.  These polished tools were differentiated
from the earlier chipped and flaked stone tools.  They had a variety of forms,
including sickles, grinding stones, and the relatively famous stone axes.  The
axes allowed the neolithic farmers to clear forest for their agriculture;
consequently the neolithic was a time of great deforestation in Europe.  Also,
the dolmens and megaliths (such as Stonehenge) across Europe were from these
neolithic cultures.

![Neolithic Axe][NeolithicAxe]

The neolithic wave also swept through parts of North Africa, merging in with
the hunter-gatherer populations there.


Kurgan Hypothesis
-----------------
Genetically, modern Europeans are primarily a combination of three groups.  The
first is the original paleolithic/mesolithic hunter-gatherers, the second is
the neolithic farmers.  The third significant contribution comes from a
population of northwest Asian steppe nomads.  These are postulated
also to be the group that brought Indo-European languages; some researchers also
believe them to have domesticated the horse and developed the chariot.

One theory (contested, of course) groups several potentially related cultures
under the moniker _Kurgan_; this is called the "Kurgan Hypothesis."  This dates
the initial development in the Pontic plains (north of the Caucuses) to about
4000 BCE, with expansion into eastern Europe and northern Anatolia about 2500
BCE, spreading eventually throughout most of Europe, Anatolia, Central Asia,
Persia, and northern India by 1000 BCE.  This Kurgan migration would eventually
splinter and give rise to the Indo-European speakers, such as the Celtic,
Germanic, Balto-Slavic, Greek, and other groups.

![Map of Kurgan hypothesis][KurganMigration]


South Asia
----------
South Asia has had a complex history, and the origins of the populations are
still somewhat unclear.  Genetically, most South Asians have two components[4],
both of which go back to the Upper Paleolithic.  One is dubbed the
_Ancestral South Indians_ (ASI), which is found only in South Asia, and the
other is the _Ancestral North Indians_ (ANI), which is found not only in South
Asia, but also in Central and West Asia, as well as in Caucasians and Europeans.
Genetic analysis suggests that these two components were mostly separate until
they started mixing about 3000 years ago.

Linguistically, South Asia is largely divided into Indo-European and Dravidian
languages.  The latter is mostly in southern India, but with some tantalizing
islands as far north as Central Asia.  The Indo-European
migration from western Eurasia spread to India (and Persia), converting the
languages spoken in the north.  Originally, it was hypothesized that this
migration involved a population assimilation or replacement, but recent genetic
analysis has shown that the gene contribution to South Asian populations is
extremely minor; the current theory is that the Indo-Europeans arrived and
became a cultural elite, with their language (and other cultural elements)
being adopted by the native populations over time.

<footnote>
[4] Portions of South Asia have strong admixtures of Tibeto-Burman and
Austro-Asian, particularly near the Himalayas and North East India,
respectively.
</footnote>


East Asia
---------
East Asia was originally populated in the first Out-of-Africa migration,
and genetically the earliest split in those migrants was between the
European/West Eurasian populations and the eastern Asian populations.  These
latter include the East Asian, Siberian, Southeast Asian, and Austronesian
peoples[5].  Agriculture developed independently in what is now China, and
these Asian Neolithic cultures spread, absorbing or displacing the other
populations in East and Southeast Asia.

An interesting phenomenon arose in Korea and Japan about 12,000 BCE.  A dense
sedentary population arose with most of the normal Neolithic trappings (pottery,
durable houses, etc), but whose economy was based on hunting and gathering,
instead of agriculture[6].  These peoples are possibly related to the current Ainu
and Okinawan populations; they were later subsumed by agriculturalists expanding
from what is now China.

<footnote>

[6] The only other place like this that we know of is in the American Pacific
Northwest.
</footnote>

Austronesian Expansion
---------------------
The pre-Austronesians were a neolithic group living in mainland China, they
migrated to Taiwan by 3500 BCE[7]. They progressively expanded, and by 2000 BCE
they had settled most of insular Southeast Asia, replacing or merging with
the existing Austro-Melanesian inhabitants.  A notable exception is the island
of New Guinea (Papua), in which malaria and geographic factors kept them from
expanding into the Highlands.  A rather adventurous group underwent a long
western journey to far-flung Madagascar, arriving there by about 0 CE.

Between about 1500 to 500 BCE, the Austronesian/Melanesian mixed population
produced the Lapita Culture, which populated most of inner Polynesia -- Fiji,
Tonga, Samoa, and the like.  By 500 CE they had populated most of outer
Polynesia, including Hawai'i and Rapa Nui (Easter Island).  Eventually, around
1200 CE, they populated New Zealand, with the Maori being their descendants.
The Lapita peoples and their descendants were the most advanced sea-farers the
world had seen, not to be surpassed until the [Age of Discovery][AgeOfDiscovery].

<footnote>
[7] The pre-Austronesian cultures that remained on the mainland were
progressively Sinicized by the expanding Han culture.

Sub-Saharan Africa
------------------
Africa, as the birthplace of Sapiens, is the continent with the greatest
genetic diversity[8].  The oldest genetic splits in Sapiens are there.  The
Khoi-san (formerly known as Bushmen) comprise the earliest known split, while
the Pygmies are the second earliest.  While Africa has
[many peoples][AfricanEthnicGroups], the
migration which had the greatest impact was the _Bantu expansion_.

Around 3000 BCE, the Bantus started expanding from the ancestral homeland in
western Africa.  Their adoption of agriculture -- as well as later use of iron --
allowed them to progressively settle in large potions of Africa previously
inhabited by hunter-gatherers.  They reached central Africa by 1500 BCE and
eastern Africa by 1000 BCE (where they may have learned of cattle from the
[Nilotic][NiloticPeoples] pastoralists).  The Khoi-san populated much of
southern Africa prior to the arrival of the Bantus, but around 500 CE the Bantus
settled much of the productive land, pushing the Khoi-san into lands such as the
arid Kalahari.

By the end of the Bantu expansion, they became the dominant culture throughout
Sub-saharan Africa.

<footnote>
[8] We focus on Sub-saharan Africa here, because historically North Africa was
bound far closer to the Mediterranean sphere.  For example, the paleolithic
hunter-gatherers of North Africa mixed with the Neolithic farmers from the
Levant, much like their northern Mediterranean neighbors.  The Nile, via Egypt
and Cush/Nubia, was one of the main corridors between the Mediterranean and
Sub-saharan Africa.
</footnote>


Conclusion
----------
The first wave of humans out of Africa covered most of the Earth by 10,000 BCE.
Various farming groups in Europe, Asia, and Africa grew numerous and expanded,
sometimes intermingling with, and sometimes displacing, the earlier wave of
humans.  An important migration of Indo-European speakers (possibly the
_Kurgans_) swept over Europe, Anatolia, Persia, Central Asia, and South Asia,
leaving a linguistic mark -- and in many cases a genetic one as well.  One of
the final waves of exploration of unpopulated lands was from the
Austronesian/Polynesian expansion, which peopled the remaining Pacific islands.

There were many other important waves of migrations we haven't covered here,
solely due to editorial choice.  The Bronze Age and Iron Age saw important
movements of peoples, and with the fall of Rome, significant migrations of
Germanic and Turkic peoples.  We'll leave those to a later note.
