Hominin Evolution
=================

Hominins -- the evolutionary line of humans -- started out as just another ape,
local to Africa and not particularly special, to creatures that dominate the
planet.  In this note, we'll talk the time from when they diverged from
the other primates, to when humans had eliminated all other hominins and spread
across the world.

This all takes place during the Paleolithic, or Old Stone Age.  It is the same
time period as the Pleistocene, which contained many fabulous animals that are
now extinct.  When people talk about "cave men", this is the period they are
talking about.

In the Mesolithic and Neolithic -- periods that occurred after the last glaciation
-- humans are the last hominin specials, and begin the change to agriculture
and civilization.  We'll leave that for another note.

In the beginning
----------------

After the Cretaceous extinction event that killed off the (non-avian) dinosaurs
65 million years ago (MYA), mammals and birds started to dominate the planet.
One of the most widespread of these groups was the primates, which evolved
somewhere between 60 and 55 MYA.   Although they are far less diverse than
before, primates include us, one of the most successful and widespread species
on the planet.

The line that includes humans split from that of the rest of the great apes
around 7.5 MYA; this line is called the _hominins_[1].  It used to
be called the _hominids_, but that term now refers to all of the great apes,
although some people still use it in the old sense.  For about 7 million years,
hominins were confind to Africa, but there were a wide number of species -- in
fact, every year it seems we discover another new hominin species.

[1] Confusingly, the clade that includes both the hominins and the chimpanzees
is called _Homininae_.

Australopithecus
-----------------
About 3.6 million years ago, Equatorial Africa was home to a variety of
primates, including the first bipedal genus, _Australopithecus_.  Similar in
size and brain capacity to modern bonobos and chimpanezees, there is evidence
for some cognitive genetic changes and tool use, and the appearance of
morphologically "modern" traits.  Australopiths are believed to be the ancestor
taxon to the genus Homo, in which humans (H. sapiens sapiens) reside.  There
were many species in this genus[2], and it's unclear which species gave rise to
_Homo_.  The famous Lucy is a member of _A. afarensis_.  Australopiths died
out about 2 MYA. 

[2] Several species, such as _A. robustus_ and _A. boisei_, are considered by some
to be members of a separate genus _Paranthropus_, which is a sister taxon to
_Homo_ (and thus not our direct ancestors).


The Paleolithic
---------------
The Paleolithic (or Old Stone Age) was the period from the demonstrated use of
stone tools by hominins (c. 3.3 MYA), to the end of the last ice age (c. 10,000
ya).  It starts with hominins being just clade, and ends with _Homo sapiens_
beginning to dominate the planet.  Many changes happened in the intervening 3
million years, so we break it down futher.  

### Lower Paleolithic
The Lower Paleolitic starts with the first stone tools found, about 3.3 MYA,
and ends around 300 thousand years ago (KYA), when tool-making and hominin
culture become significantly more complex.  We don't know what species made the
first tools, but we know tools were used by the the first species of _Homo_,
_Homo habilis_ (2.5 MYA to 1.5 MYA).  Habilis was bipedal, and used stone and
bone tools.  A variety of _Homo_ species appear and disappear in the period,
including the important _Homo erectus_ (1.8 MYA to 70 KYA).  _Homo erectus_
spread widely throughout Asia, and includes the famous _Peking Man_ fossil.
Around the end of this period, _Homo erectus_ were the first hominins to master
fire (about 300 KYA) [3].  They were major players in the Middle Paleolithic,
as well.

(Find pictures of Olduwan and Acheulean stone tools).

[3] There is some evidence fire was used as early as 1.5 MYA, but it's not certain.

### Middle Paleolithic
The Middle Paleolithic started about 300 KYA, and ended about 50 KYA.  In
this periods, _Homo neanderthalensis_ (400 KYA) and _Homo sapiens_ (250 KYA)
appeared.  Also, in this period, the first signs of _cultural modernity_
appear:

* More advanced stone tool techniques, as well as spears.
* Art, including beads, rock paintings, and body painting.
* Long distance trade, including for ochre, which might have had ritual uses.
* Burial traditions. 
* Care for the elderly and the injured.
* Larger-scale cooperation in hunting social groups.

By the end of the MP, Neanderthals are found throughout Europe, _H erectus_
are found throughout Asia, and various other _Homo_ species appear in various
pockets.  Humans are just beginning to leave Africa, but quickly appear in
almost all corners of the planet.

### Upper Paleolithic
The Upper Paleolithic spans the bitterest parts of the last glaciation, from 50
KYA to when the glaciers start retreating about 10 KYA.  Around 50-70 KYA, _H
sapiens_ underwent a "cognitive revolution."  Prior to the UP, stone tools were
hard to differentiate.  Starting with the UP, there is a bewildering variety of
specialized knives, bows and arrows, engraving tools, ropes, oil lamps, fish
hooks, nets, rafts, and more.  Art and music became more complex, as evidenced
by cave paintings and instruments such as flutes.

In addition, the first evidence of cultural differentiation appeared.  Prior to the
UP, tool and structures were similar across species (Neanderthals, Sapiens,
etc), and across geography.  In the UP, human bands in different locations have
distinct styles of houses, tools, burials, etc.

The Upper Paleolithic starts with Sapiens just starting to leave Africa, and with
a wealth of other _Homo_ species in various parts of the planet.  It ends with
Sapiens spread to almost everywhere[4], replacing (and perhaps exterminating)
all other species of _Homo_.

[4] Except some islands in the Pacific, etc, that will be colonized much later.

Our extinct cousins
-------------------

The web of genus _Homo_ is growing increasingly complex.  On one handle, we are
finding increasing number of fossils that suggest new species, and ones with
intriguing mixtures of modern and archaic features.  But some of the most
exciting discoveries have involved our interbreeding with archaic populations.

Neanderthals were dominant in Europe until Sapiens spread in the Upper Paleolithic.
In the Middle Paleolithic, the was a moderately well-defined border between the
populations, that shifted north and south as the temperature fluctuated.
Around 50 KYA, Sapiens start to expand globally and replace Neanderthals, but it
appears that some interbreeding took place.  Non-African humans share 1%-4% of
their genome with Neanderthals.

Denisovans are another archaic _Homo_ species that are known from a small number
of samples.  They divered from the Neanderthal line shortly after it diverged
from the Sapien line, and in some cases interbred later with Neanderthals.  They
also interbred with Sapiens; approximately 4%-6% of the genome in Melanesians,
and a lesser amount in Aboriginal Australians, comes from the Denisovans.  East
Asians have about 0.2% Denisovan genes, perhaps including a high-altitude gene
found in Tibetans.  There is also evidence that Denisovans interbred with another
(currently unknown) archaic human line.  Watch this space; it will only get
more complicated the more samples we find.

Summary (TL;DR)
---------------

* 3 MYA: first use of stone tools
* 300 KYA: mastery of fire and cultural modernity
* 250 KYA: First _Homo sapiens_
* 70-50 KYA: Cognitive revolution; advanced toolmaking and culture.
* 40 KYA: _Homo sapiens_ leave Africa and go almost everywhere.
* 10 KYA: Glaciers recede, Sapiens dominance -- and history -- begins.
