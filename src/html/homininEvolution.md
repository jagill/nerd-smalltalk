Hominin Evolution
=================

Hominins -- the evolutionary line of humans -- started out as just another ape,
local to Africa and not particularly special.  They evolved to creatures that
dominate the planet.  In this note, we'll talk about the time from when they
diverged from the other primates, to when humans had eliminated all other
hominins and spread across the world.

This all takes place during the Paleolithic, or Old Stone Age.  It is the same
time period as the Pleistocene, which contained many fabulous animals that are
now extinct.  When people talk about "cave men", this is the period they are
talking about.

In the Mesolithic and Neolithic -- periods that occurred after the last
glaciation -- humans are the only remaining hominin species, and begin the
change to agriculture and civilization.  We'll leave that for another note.

In the beginning
----------------
After the Cretaceous extinction event that killed off the (non-avian) dinosaurs
65 million years ago (MYA), mammals and birds started to dominate the planet.
One of the most widespread of these groups was the primates, which evolved
somewhere between 60 and 55 MYA.   Primates were a very successful and diverse
group, our cousins the apes split from the rest of the primates around 15-20 MYA.

The line that includes humans split from that of the rest of the great apes
around 7.5 MYA; this line is called the _hominins_[1].  It used to
be called the _hominids_, but that term now refers to all of the great apes,
although some people still use it in the old sense.  For about 7 million years,
hominins were confined to Africa, but there were a wide number of species -- in
fact, every year it seems we discover another new hominin species.

[1] Confusingly, the clade that includes both the hominins and the chimpanzees
is called _Homininae_.

Australopithecus
-----------------
About 3.6 million years ago, Equatorial Africa was home to a variety of
primates, including the first bipedal genus, _Australopithecus_.  Similar in
size and brain capacity to modern bonobos and chimpanezees, there is evidence
for some cognitive genetic changes and tool use, and the appearance of
morphologically "modern" traits.  Australopiths are believed to be the ancestor
taxon to the genus Homo, in which humans (H. sapiens sapiens) reside.  There
were many species in this genus[2], and it's unclear which species gave rise to
_Homo_.  The famous Lucy is a member of _A. afarensis_.  Australopiths died
out about 2 MYA.

[2] Several species, such as _A. robustus_ and _A. boisei_, are considered by some
to be members of a separate genus _Paranthropus_, which is a sister taxon to
_Homo_ (and thus not our direct ancestors).


The Paleolithic
---------------
The Paleolithic (or Old Stone Age) was the period from the demonstrated use of
stone tools by hominins (c. 3.3 MYA), to the end of the last ice age (c. 10,000
ya).  It starts with hominins being just another clade, and ends with _Homo
sapiens_ beginning to dominate the planet.  Tools evolved from a very primitive generic stone axe, to a bewildering array of carefully crafted specialized instruments. The 3 million years of the Paleolithic are broken down into the
Lower, Middle, and Upper Paleolithic, representing increasingly levels of
cultural and technological sophistication.

### Lower Paleolithic
The _Lower Paleolithic_ starts with the first stone tools found, about 3.3 MYA,
and ends around 300 thousand years ago (KYA), when tool-making and hominin
culture become significantly more complex.  We don't know what species made the
first tools, but we know tools were used by the the first species of _Homo_,
_Homo habilis_ (2.5 MYA to 1.5 MYA).  Habilis was bipedal, and used stone and
bone tools.  These first stone tools are called the _Oldowan Industry_, which were made by striking a stone (with another stone) to create a sharp edge.

Amongst the variety of _Homo_ species that appear and disappear in the period,
_Homo erectus_ stands out (1.8 MYA to 70 KYA).  _Homo erectus_
spread widely throughout Asia, and includes the famous _Peking Man_ fossil.
_H erectus_ refined tool-making and developed the _Archeulean Industry_, more
refined stone tools that used pressure flaking to make long, two-sided edges.

To add to their accomplishments, _Homo erectus_ were the first hominins to master fire (about 300 KYA) [3].

[3] There is some evidence fire was used as early as 1.5 MYA, but it's not certain.

### Middle Paleolithic
The _Middle Paleolithic_ started about 300 KYA, and ended about 50 KYA.  In
this period, _Homo neanderthalensis_ (400 KYA) and _Homo sapiens_ (250 KYA)
appeared.  They further refined tool making technology to allow finer stone
points, which were at times mounted on shafts to make spears.

Also in this period, the first signs of _cultural modernity_ appear:

* Art, including beads, rock paintings, and body painting.
* Long distance trade, including for ochre, which might have had ritual uses.
* Burial traditions.
* Care for the elderly and the injured.
* Larger-scale cooperation in hunting social groups.

By the end of the Middle Paleolithic, Neanderthals are found throughout Europe,
_H erectus_ are found throughout Asia, and various other _Homo_ species appear
in various pockets.  Humans are just beginning to leave Africa, but quickly
appear in almost all corners of the planet.   

### Upper Paleolithic
The _Upper Paleolithic_ (UP) spans the bitterest parts of the last glaciation,
from 50 KYA to when the glaciers start retreating about 10 KYA.  Around 50-70
KYA, _H sapiens_ underwent a "cognitive revolution."  Prior to the UP, stone
tools were hard to differentiate.  Starting with the UP, there is a bewildering
variety of specialized knives, bows and arrows, engraving tools, ropes, oil
lamps, fish hooks, nets, rafts, and more.  Art and music became more complex, as
evidenced by cave paintings and instruments such as flutes.

In addition, the first evidence of cultural differentiation appeared.  Prior to
the UP, tool and structures were similar across species (Neanderthals, Sapiens,
etc), and across geography.  In the UP, human bands in different locations have
distinct styles of houses, tools, burials, etc.

The Upper Paleolithic starts with Sapiens just starting to leave Africa, and
with a wealth of other _Homo_ species in various parts of the planet.  It ends
with Sapiens spread to almost everywhere[4], replacing (and perhaps
exterminating) all other species of _Homo_.

[4] Except some islands (such as in the Pacific) that will be colonized much
later.

Our extinct cousins
-------------------

The web of genus _Homo_ is growing increasingly complex.  We are finding
increasing number of fossils that suggest new species, and ones with intriguing
mixtures of modern and archaic features.  But some of the most exciting
discoveries have involved our interbreeding with archaic populations.

Neanderthals were dominant in Europe until Sapiens spread in the Upper Paleolithic.
In the Middle Paleolithic, the was a moderately well-defined border between the
populations, that shifted north and south as the temperature fluctuated.
Around 50 KYA, Sapiens start to expand globally and replace Neanderthals.  It is
unknown how much of that was caused by conflict, but it appears that at least
some interbreeding took place.  Recent genetic analysis shows that non-African
humans share 1%-4% of their genome with Neanderthals.

Denisovans are another archaic _Homo_ species that are known from a small number
of samples.  They diverged from the Neanderthal line shortly after it diverged
from the Sapiens line, and in some cases interbred later with Neanderthals.  They
also interbred with Sapiens; approximately 4%-6% of the genome in Melanesians,
and a lesser amount in Aboriginal Australians, comes from the Denisovans.  East
Asians have about 0.2% Denisovan genes, perhaps including a high-altitude gene
found in Tibetans.  There is also evidence that Denisovans interbred with another
(currently unknown) archaic human line.

One species discovered in 2003 is _Homo floresiensis_, which has been nicknamed
"hobbit".  They lived on the island of Flores in Indonesia, and they stood about
3.5 feet (1.1 m) in height.  Their brain was commensurately small; it is
hypothesized that this is an example of island dwarfism.  From the dating of
the remains, _H floresiensis_ might have been alive as late as 12 KYA, the most
recently living non-human hominin.

Watch this space; it will only get more complicated the more samples we find.

Summary (TL;DR)
---------------

* 3 MYA: first use of stone tools, probably by _Australopithecus_.
* 1/4 MYA: mastery of fire, first bits of culture, and first _Homo sapiens_.
* 50 KYA: Cognitive revolution; advanced toolmaking and culture, Sapiens leave
  Africa and go almost everywhere.
* 10 KYA: Glaciers recede, Sapiens dominance -- and history -- begins.
