Deserts and Hadley Cells
============
Take a look at a world map (or perhaps Google Earth).  Look west to east along
30º latitude (North or South).  Notice the preponderance of deserts on these
parallels; in the north we have northern Mexico and the American Southwest,
the Sahara, and the Arabian desert.  In the south, we have the Atacama desert,
the Namibian desert, the Kalahari, and the Australian Outback.  In fact, almost
all the worlds major deserts are along these parallels.  Furthermore, all of
the Mediterranean climates occur just poleward of these deserts, on the west
coasts of continents.

This (and more) is caused by a fascinating phenomenon called Hadley Cells.

The Sun and Rain Storms
-----------------------
The light from the sun passes through (non-cloudy) air mostly without being
absorbed, depositing its heat into the surface of the earth.  When
this surface is water, the water warms up and heats and humidifies the air
right above it.  The warm, wet air is less dense than the air above it,
so it rises up.  As it rises, it expands due to the decreasing pressure;
this cools it[1].  As it cools, it cannot hold as much humidity, which
precipitates; as water condenses, it releases its [latent heat][LatentHeat],
which warms the air and allows it continue to rise and continue this cycle.

This is the process that creates the fluffy "cotton-ball"
[Cumulus clouds][CumulusClouds].  If the process condenses enough moisture,
it results in a rain storm.  You may have noticed that the Cumulus clouds seem
to stay at a certain height in the sky; you might also have noticed that during
some storms these clouds take on an anvil or [thunderhead][Thunderhead] shape,
where the cloud expands in its upper portion, and whose top is strangely flat.
This is due to the [Tropopause][Tropopause], a point in the atmosphere where the
temperature of the air increases with height.  The rising air packets find that
the air surrounding it is the same temperature, and their rise stops.

<footnote>
[1] As it expands, it exerts force on the surrounding air,
doing work.  This work reduces its internal energy, i.e. heat.

Hadley Cells
------------
The Sun is most intense at the equator, since it is "directly above" there, and
its rays hit the surface almost perpendicularly.  This means, if you average
over the day/night cycle (called "zonally averaged"), the equator has more of
this upwelling air than latitudes further poleward.  When it expands, it must
expand poleward, which sets up an air flow (in the Tropopause) towards the
poles.

If the earth wasn't rotating, this flow would continue poleward until it hit
the poles, where it would meet the poleward-flowing air from other parts of the
equator.  Since this air would have no where else to go, it would sink down to
the poles.  And since air is rising up at the equators, the polar air would be
drawn back to the equator, closer to ground level, completing the cycle.

The rotation of the earth induces the [Coriolis Effect][CoriolisEffect][2],
which deflects moving things in the Northern Hemisphere to the right (and in the
Southern Hemisphere to the left).  As the air starts moving poleward, it gets
deflected to the east.  Between this and friction it sinks down to the surface;
a somewhat involved calculation finds the latitude of sinking to be about 30º.
In Climatology, the latitudes near 30º are called the _subtropics_, and this
band of sinking air is called the _Subtropical Ridge_.

Remember that the air lost much of its heat and moisture in the original ascent;
it continues to cool and dry out on its poleward journey.  Thus the air that
comes down at 30º is cold and dry, greatly decreasing how much rain occurs at
that latitude.

This is the Hadley Cell, which causes increased rainfall near the equator, and
drastically reduces precipitation in the subtropics.  It is this decreased
precipitation that causes the deserts around 30º latitude.

Trade Winds and Mid-Latitude Westerlies
----
As the air sinks at the Subtropical Ridge, it must spread out.  Much of it goes
equatorward, but some goes poleward.  The Coriolis Effect deflects this air to
the right in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the left in the Southern.  This
means -- in either Hemisphere -- the equatorward air heads increasingly to the
west, and the poleward flowing air heads to the east.

The equatorward currents make the Trade Winds, called "easterly" because they
come from the east.  Just north of the equator they head southwest, and just
south of the equator they head northwest, guiding sailing ships to the equator
and west. The poleward currents make the Mid-Latitude Westerlies, causing the
dominant average winds in the latitudes from 40º to 50º to go from west to east.
These winds bring weather systems with them; generally weather that
hits Oregon will make its way to the East Coast of the U.S.

These winds had very important effects in the Age of Sail.  Due to the South
Atlantic High the prevailing winds along the west coast of Africa
go north[3], making sailing down the coast difficult.  Traders going from
Portugal to southern Africa would actually take the Trade Winds west, go down
along the coast of South America, then take the westerlies back across to
Africa.

[3] We'll discuss the wind patterns around Subtropical Highs below.

Mediterranean Climates
----
Mediterranean climates are characterized by dry summers and wet winters.  Many
such climates will have three or four months of no rain in the summer, but
frequent rains throughout the winter.  What causes such weather patterns?  Once
again, it is the Hadley Cells and the Subtropical Ridge.

We made an important simplification above that it's time to revisit.  We claimed
that the sun was directly above the equator, thus the upwelling of warm, humid
air was at the equator.  However, the axis of the Earth's rotation is tilted
with respect the orbital plane, by about 23º.  When the north pole is pointed
towards the sun (ie, northern Summer/southern Winter), the sun is over 23ºN
latitude, and similarly for the south.  The tropical upwelling similarly tracks
the Sun's latitude, although oceanic effects dampens the migration.  Even with
the dampening, this zone can migrate from 15ºN to 15ºS.

The Subtropical Ridge is sourced by the tropical upwelling, and when the
upwelling moves, so does the ridge.  In the Summer, the ridge and its associated
dry, rainless weather moves poleward, and in the Winter it moves south.
Regions with a Mediterranean climate are in the ridge in the Summer and get
no rain; in the Winter the ridge has moved southward and the rains return.  The
further north the region, the fewer months of the year they are in the ridge.
For example, Seattle is at about 47ºN and gets only about a month (about August)
of the dry ridge weather, while San Francisco is about 37ºN and is in the ridge
roughly between May and October, about half a year.

Subtropical Highs
-----------------
Why aren't there Mediterranean climates on the east coasts of continents?  This
is due to Subtropical Highs.

The Subtropical Ridge over large bodies of water forms persistent regions of
high pressure, called Subtropical Highs.  As the descending air piles on top of
existing air, it makes a
dense area of high pressure, which pushes air out.  As the air goes out
radially it gets deflected by the Coriolis Effect.  In the Northern Hemisphere
this deflection is to the right (and in the Southern, left), causing the air
to start to spiral around the high pressure region.  The Coriolis Effect keeps
trying to turn the air, but eventually it would be turning it back into the
high pressure region.  At that point, the force from the pressure balances the
Coriolis Effect, and the air flows circularly.  In the Northern Hemisphere,
this flow is clockwise, and in the Southern anti-clockwise.

![Simplified wind patterns in high pressure regions][CoriolisPressureRegion]

We've seen that the Subtropical Ridge over an ocean sets up steady winds on the
Oceans circulating around 30º latitude.  There are five persistent regions of
this: the North Atlantic (aka Azores or Bermuda) High, South Atlantic High,
North Pacific High, South Pacific High, and the Indian Ocean High.  The winds
caused thereby travel west along the equator (the Trade Winds), then poleward
along the east coast of the continent west of the High, then eastward around
45º latitude, then equatorward along the west coast of the continent east of
the High.  This wind completes a great cycle, which is relatively persistent.
This persistence drives great circular currents in the ocean called _gyres_,
which roughly follow the same path as the winds.[4]

![Map of Subtropical High Winds and Gyres][Gyres]

The wind that runs down the west coast of continents comes from the poles, while
the wind going up the east coast of continents comes from the tropics.  Thus
wind on the east coast is in general warmer and more humid than that on the
west coast.  Furthermore, these winds bring tropical storms (such as hurricanes)
up the coast during the summer, which results in a large amount of
precipitation.  The east coast subtropics are correspondingly wetter and
greener.

Summary
----
The sun heats the ocean, which causes warm humid air to rise to the Tropopause.
This effect is strongest where the sun is directly overhead, near the equator.
This rising air spreads poleward, and the Coriolis Effect deflects the flow to
the East.  This causes a downwelling of dry air (the Subtropical Ridge)
at about 30º latitude; thus
regions at this latitude tend to be very dry.  Most of earth's deserts are near
this latitude.  The descending air spreads poleward and equatorward; these flows
are also affected by the Coriolis Effect.  This leads to the easterly (from
east to west) Trade Winds at the equator, and the Mid-Latitude Westerlies around
45º latitude.

The actual location of the Subtropical Ridge varies over the year due to the
earth's tilt changing where the sun appears in the sky.  It moves north in
the northern Summer/southern Winter, and south in the northern Summer/souther
Winter. Regions who are in the ridge during
the Summer but not in the Winter (if they are on the west coast of
continents) have Mediterranean climates, with dry summers and rainy winters.
East coast subtropics get tropical storms blown to them, keeping their summers
wet.
