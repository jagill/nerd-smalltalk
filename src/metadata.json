      "summary": "Hominins -- the evolutionary line of humans -- started out as just another ape, local to Africa and not particularly special.  They evolved to creatures that dominate the planet.  In this NST, we'll talk about the time from when they diverged from the other primates, to when humans had eliminated all other hominins and spread across the world."

      "summary": "Once humans were confined to Africa, yet now they are all over the world.  The story of how this came to be is complex and fascinating, involving many waves of migration, conquest, and intermarriage.  In this NST, we'll talk about the major human migrations of the Stone Age.  We'll also talk about several later ones (e.g. the Polynesians) which are important to know.  After reading this note, you should be to know roughly how and when each major population group got to their ancestral home."
